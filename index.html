    <h1>Dummy sample file</h1>
    <p>I'm trying to learn git and github and use it with VSCode!</p>

    <h2>Creating A New Branch</h2>
    <p>Typically, you'd wanna create a new branch when you want to add new features. For example, this added paragraph is a new feature.
    <br>Note that the area on the left is the "gutter" where you can see what type is new data. Green line = New lines, shaded blue = modified, red arrow = deleted.</p>
